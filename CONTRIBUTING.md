# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

This project was built using [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). While the built `rxjs-uploader` library does not depend on Angular, this project does.

Please note we have a code of conduct. Please follow it in all of your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are in the proper dependency object in the `package.json` file. Additionally, if new peer dependencies have been introduced, add them to `projects/rxjs-uploader/package.json`.
2. Update the README.md with any changes to the public API.
3. Increase the version numbers in `package.json` and `projects/rxjs-uploader/package.json` and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Run the test suite (`npm test`) to ensure unit tests are still passing. Add unit tests for your added logic as appropriate.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Style Guide

Please conform to our `tslint` and `.stylelintrc` files in order to maintain a consistent coding style. We recommend the `stylelint` VS Code extension for SASS linting.

## How to Build

### Module
To build the core module, simply run `npm run build` in the root of this repository. This will build the module locally to the `dist` folder. The contents of `dist` are what eventually gets published to the npm registry.

### Demo application
Run `npm start` to run the demo application. While running, any changes to either the demo app or the library will trigger a reload, and you'll see your changes live.

## Code of Conduct

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

reported by contacting the project team at developers@lsq.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
